title: Tim Statler | Technical Writer
---

I'm Tim Statler, a technical writer with experience in software documentation, API documentation, and user guides. I've written documentation for web applications, REST APIs, and SDKs. I've also written user guides for software products and administrator guides for web applications.


## Portfolio

The following are publicly available writing samples of my previous work. I have also written extensively for internal developer audiences at Cisco, Meta, and Google, which are mentioned here but are not publicly available.

### Cisco Security Cloud

I was the sole technical writer for the Cisco Security Cloud platform, which provided a unified customer experience across all Cisco cybersecurity products. This included public documentation (linked below) and internal documentation for a corresponding service and API used by Cisco product teams to obtain product subscription changes from upstream marketplaces.

[Security Cloud Control User Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/security_cloud/security_cloud_control/user_guide/b_security_cloud_control_user_guide.html){target=_blank}

:   I wrote the user guide for Cisco Security Cloud Control, a web application where Cisco customers manage their product subscriptions, activate new product instances, and manage enterprises and users.

[Identity Provider Integration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/cloud_control/sso-secure-cloud-control-app/identity-provider-instructions.html){target=_blank}
 
:   I researched and wrote detailed procedures for integrating various identity provider services with Security Cloud Control's single sign-on solution, Security Cloud Sign On, using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).

### Apcera compute platform

I wrote and maintained documentation for a multi-cloud container management system that included package management, virtual networking, and container runtime. The documentation included API references, user guides, and tutorials for developers and administrators. The following links are to archived versions of the documentation, as the company was shut down after being acquired by Ericsson.

[Apcera Platform API Reference](https://web.archive.org/web/20161007015409/http://docs.apcera.com/api/apcera-api-endpoints/){target=_blank}

:   I created the initial platform API reference for the Apcera Platform from an OpenAPI specification that I curated and maintained. 

[Apcera Platform API Recipes](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905180915/http://docs.apcera.com/api/api-tasks/){target=_blank}
  
:   I researched and wrote the API "recipes" for the Apcera Platform, which showed developers how to combine API calls to perform common platform tasks, including creating and managing jobs, packages, and networks

[Events System API](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905180915/https://docs.apcera.com/api/events-system-api){target=_blank}

:   I researched and wrote the API reference for the Apcera Platform's events system, which allowed users to subscribe to events in the platform and receive notifications when the events occurred.

[Defining Routes](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905181112/http://docs.apcera.com/jobs/routes/){target=_blank}

:   I wrote the user guide for defining routes in the Apcera Platform, which defines how HTTP requests are routed to applications ("jobs") running on the platform.

[Creating and Using Virtual Routes](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905181445/http://docs.apcera.com/jobs/virtual-networks/){target=_blank}

:   I researched and wrote the user guide for creating and using virtual networks in the Apcera Platform, which allowed users to create isolated networks for their applications.

### Internal developer documentation

## Meta (Facebook) Developer Infrastructure

: [Meta DevInfra](https://engineering.fb.com/category/developer-tools/){target=_blank}

I worked on an internal team at Meta that was responsible for documenting tools and processes used by Meta developers to manage all aspects of building, deploying, and maintaining the backend services used by Facebook, Instagram, and other properties. I researched and wrote documentation for an SDK that let developers quickly bootstrap new services in Python or C++, including package management, configure CI/CD, run tests, and deploy to production.
